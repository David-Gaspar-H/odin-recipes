            <li>1½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed</li>

            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) fillets tilapia</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>2 medium Roma tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a medium saucepan. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, mix olive oil, garlic, paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon spiced oil into a small bowl; whisk in yogurt and season with salt and pepper. Set yogurt sauce aside.</li>
            <li>Place tilapia fillets on the prepared baking sheet and rub with 2 tablespoons spiced oil.</li>
            <li>Add chickpeas, tomatoes, and 1/2 cup cilantro to the remaining spiced oil mixture; toss to coat. Pour onto the baking sheet around the tilapia. Season everything generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tilapia is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on size.</li>
            <li>Fluff cooked rice with a fork and divide onto 4 plates. Place tilapia on rice and spoon chickpea mixture over top. Top with yogurt sauce and remaining cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
